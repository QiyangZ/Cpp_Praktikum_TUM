# C++_Praktikum_TUM
## Brief Introduction
This is a practise for who wants to learn about C++. There are five-days' assignments. The first three days are the practise of basic knowledge of C++. And then we need to control a small moon-rover with the help of C++ in two ways: `Keyboard Contorl` and `Certain Orbits`.
For the first three days, there are about 30 assignments and I have written each of them in the description of corresponding .cpp files. You can read them and then do them by yourself and then compare with the code I've uploaded (if you want).
For any question, you are welcome to leave a commit here. :D

## How to use the code to learn C++
I think the best way to learn a programming language is to practice more. After learning about the basic knowledge you can do some tiny projects by yourself, and at that time you will know better about that. You will find that there are so many functions and methods which are mentioned in the book, you can not wirte them to the code or can not apply the at all. Whenever at this time, you need some code-examples to understand them. That will be much easier than reading a book or some papers. Here is a good way to learn C++. For each day I will add a `README` file, to introduce what you can see in each little programm, just like a catalog.
